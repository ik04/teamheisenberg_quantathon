# Quantum Energy Calculation with VQE

![Project Banner](path_to_banner_image)

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in solving quantum energy calculation problems. VQE is a quantum algorithm used to find the lowest energy state (eigenvalue) of a given Hamiltonian, which has broad applications in fields such as quantum chemistry and material science.

## Features

- **Quantum Energy Calculation:** Utilize VQE algorithm to compute the lowest energy state of a given Hamiltonian.
- **Hamiltonian Definition:** Define the Hamiltonian terms corresponding to the system under study.
- **Ansatz Circuit:** Configure the ansatz circuit using `TwoLocal` for quantum state preparation.
- **Optimizer Setup:** Implement the SPSA optimizer to minimize the energy and find the ground state.
- **Quantum Visualization:** Visualize the eigenstate using Bloch sphere representation.
